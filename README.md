# Star Car Rental

## Project by Chris Addeo

Are you a curious car renter? Well this is the perfect place for you! This web app showcases and lets you search different car brands, models, and years at a whim.

This is run on Next JS, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. It fetches data from ["Cars" by API-Ninjas](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/cars-by-api-ninjas) on [RapidApi.com](https://rapidapi.com/hub).

Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a car image generator that works for free and also scales with the needs of this project. This is also to be expanded and acts as a showcase for other potential features that could be built on for a more fully functional platform.

Enjoy!
